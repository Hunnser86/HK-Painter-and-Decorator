## HK Painting and Decorating Website.

This Is my first milestone project in my Diploma in Software Development course.


This website was designed with many devices in mind, so it needed to be responsive and easy to navigate, for potential customers.

## User Experience
---


* ### **User Stories**
     
     * **Goals for first time visitors**
        
        * First time visitors Should be able to come to the site and immediately understand the purpose of the site.

        * They should be able to easily achieve what they came to do (i.e get a quote for a decorating service).

        * They should be able to view past works on a portfolio page, which is set out clearly and easy to see.

        * They will also be able to find their social media sites and other contact information.


    * **Goals for returning visitors**

       * Returning visitors should be able to quickly contact and hire the tradesperson, quickly and hassle free.



* **Design**

   * **Colours**
       
       * The colours that I used, were the two main colours from the businesses logo.  A green/blue colour and a mid tone orange.
       
        * The main text color for the body was slategray.  For the headers, I used aliceblue.

   * **Typography**

       *  I used the font Poppins as the main font for the website, and I used Sans Serif as a secondary font, incase Poppins did not load correctly.  I used Poppins, as it is easy to read and has a soft rounded look, which feels welcoming.

   * **Imagery**

     *  The imagery I used on the landing page is contextual to the product being promoted on the site, as it is of a paint roller for the landing page.  
        I edited the photo on canva and adjusted the brightness, just enough to give some contrast to the text above it, but not so much as to stop the viewer from making it out.

* **Wireframes**

    * I made wire frames for each type of device that would potentially be used when viewing the website.

# Technologies Used

## **Launguages**

 * [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

 ## **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used**

 1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)

    * I used Google Fonts to link the Poppins font for use on the website. 
 
 2. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)

    * I used Font Awesome to provide the social media links in the footer of the site.

 3. [Bootstrap V5.0.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

    * I used bootstrap to help with the responsiveness of the site, and to provide the information for the form on the quotes page.

 4. [jsdelivr:](https://getbootstrap.com/)   

   * jsdelivr was used to enable GitHub to serve my web files without any configuration.

 5. [Git:](https://github.com/)  

    * Git was used for version control of the website by using the git commit and git push functions in the terminal, to to ensure any changes I made were not lost and were also meaningful to the development process. It would also help any other developers to assess or make changes in a real world setting.

 6. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)

    *  GitHub was used to store the code from the project after being pushed from the terminal.

 7. [Adobe XD:](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html)  

    * I used Adobe XD for the Wireframe, to full site visual design process.
