# My First Milestone Project
## HK Painting and Decorating Website.
---

This Is my first milestone project in my Diploma in Software Development course.


This website was designed with many devices in mind, so it needed to be responsive and easy to navigate, for potential customers.

## User Experience
---


* ### **User Stories**
     
     * **Goals for first time visitors**
        
        * First time visitors Should be able to come to the site and immediately understand the purpose of the site.

        * They should be able to easily achieve what they came to do (i.e get a quote for a decorating service).

        * They should be able to view past works on a portfolio page, which is set out clearly and easy to see.

        * They will also be able to find their social media sites and other contact information.


    * **Goals for returning visitors**

       * Returning visitors should be able to quickly contact and hire the tradesperson, quickly and hassle free.



* **Design**

   * **Colours**
       
       * The colours that I used, were the two main colours from the businesses logo.  A green/blue colour and a mid tone orange.
       
        * The main text color for the body was slategray.  For the headers, I used aliceblue.

   * **Typography**

       *  I used the font Poppins as the main font for the website, and I used Sans Serif as a secondary font, incase Poppins did not load correctly.  I used Poppins, as it is easy to read and has a soft rounded look, which feels welcoming.

   * **Imagery**

     *  The imagery I used on the landing page is contextual to the product being promoted on the site, as it is of a paint roller for the landing page.  
        I edited the photo on canva and adjusted the brightness, just enough to give some contrast to the text above it, but not so much as to stop the viewer from making it out.

* **Wireframes**

    * I made wire frames for each type of device that would potentially be used when viewing the website.

# Features 
  * Responsive on different devices and screen sizes.

  * Interactive elements, including button hover and page load animations.

  * A form on the contact page, to allow people to get a quote.

# Technologies Used

## **Launguages**

    
 * [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
 
 * [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

 ## **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used**

 1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)

    * I used Google Fonts to link the Poppins font for use on the website. 
 
 2. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)

    * I used Font Awesome to provide the social media links in the footer of the site.

 3. [Bootstrap V5.0.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

    * I used bootstrap to help with the responsiveness of the site, and to provide the information for the form on the quotes page.

 4. [jsdelivr:](https://getbootstrap.com/)   

   * jsdelivr was used to enable GitHub to serve my web files without any configuration.

 5. [Git:](https://github.com/)  

    * Git was used for version control of the website by using the git commit and git push functions in the terminal, to to ensure any changes I made were not lost and were also meaningful to the development process. It would also help any other developers to assess or make changes in a real world setting.

 6. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)

    *  GitHub was used to store the code from the project after being pushed from the terminal.

 7. [Adobe XD:](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html)  

    * I used Adobe XD for the Wireframe, to full site visual design process.


# Testing

For my testing I used a mixture of automated testing and client based testing.

For the automated testing, I used the following;

- [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- [W3C Markup Validation]( https://validator.w3.org/)

These were used in particular, to check the validity of the code for my site.

## User Stories testing

  * **First time visitors Should be able to come to the site and immediately understand the purpose of the site.**
    
    * The site provides an explaination, letting the customer where they are and
    what the site is for.  Each page contains a Nav at the top of the screen, and for 
    each piece of content, there is a button beneath linking to the relevant 
    page with contextual text. e.g. "View more projects", will take you to the 
    portfolio page.  This makes it easy for the customer to achieve their goal 
    for coming to the site.

 * **They should be able to view past works on a portfolio page, which is set out clearly and easy to see.**

   * I went one step further with this, as I used a carousel on the home page, to show
   some past works, along with some customer testimonials.  There is also a button beneath 
   it linking to the portfolio page.  The portfolio page is set out simply and clearly, 
   so the customer can easily view a picture along with an explaination of a past job.  When you hover
   over the cards (or touch on mobile) they scale up so the customer can focus more on that
   particular card.

* **They will also be able to find their social media sites and other contact information.**

  * Each page has a footer with all the social media links, displayed as icons, for quick recognition
  and easy access.  It also contains relevant contact details like phone number and email address.

  * On the home page, there is an iframe with an embedded google map to show the location and allow 
  the customer to get directions to the company HQ.

* **Returning visitors should be able to quickly contact and hire the tradesperson, quickly and hassle free.**
  
  * This is easily achieved, as the site is very easy to navigate.  Having been there once, a customer 
  is eaily able to navigate around the site, to contact the tradesperson.

* **Mobile screens and responsiveness**

  * I tested the site on all the breakpoints on Google Dev Tools, and the site flowed and scaled
  up and down nicely.  It was nice and wide, with big text on the larger screens, and then it scaled 
  down to flow in vertical columns on mobile devices.

* **Known Bugs**

  * The only real bug that I found after testing the site, was that the header on the home and 
  contact pages seemed to flow out of their columns on a Huawei phone.  However, on all the mobile
  breakpoints on Google dev tools, it all worked and scaled properly.


# Deployment

  * To deploy the website, I used [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  
    The process for this was simple.  I used the terminal on the [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    IDE.  I used the git add . command to add all the files that had been worked on.  Next I used the git commit
    command, to commit my files ready for deployment, followed by the git push command, to push the code to 
    [GitHub](https://github.com/).

    I also did this during development, so as not to loose and changes or work that I had done.

  * To run the code locally, go to [My GitHub](https://github.com/Hunnser86/Milestone-project-version-3).

    Go to settings and scroll down to the [GitHub pages] section of the page, and click on the [link](https://hunnser86.github.io/Milestone-project-version-3/).

    Then have fun exploring the site.
